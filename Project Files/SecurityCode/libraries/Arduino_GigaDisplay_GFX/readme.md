# Arduino_GigaDisplay_GFX

**Arduino_GigaDisplay_GFX** is a layer library for using methods from the [Adafruit GFX]() graphics core library, developed for the [Arduino GIGA Display Shield]() and the [Arduino GIGA R1 WiFi]() board.

It can be used to draw anything from single pixels to advanced geometrical shapes, and supports printing text / values with configurable font sizes. 

To get started with this library and the shield, visit the [GIGA Display Shield GFX Guide](https://docs.arduino.cc/tutorials/giga-display-shield/gfx-guide).

>**Note:** this library requires version `4.0.6` and above of the [GIGA core](https://github.com/arduino/ArduinoCore-mbed) to be installed.
